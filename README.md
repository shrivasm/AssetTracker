----- THE ASSET TRACKER -----

This is my project, a Macro-Enabled Excel Worksheet Project that I've been working on that I like to call the ASSET TRACKER. It's a workbook with two major functions: ASSET TRACKER and PORTFOLIO BUILDER.

1. ASSET TRACKER

   Do you want to understand how the assets we trade work? How they can be quantitatively, or visually measured? If so, the ASSET TRACKER is your best bet. Boasting over 600 securities ranging from Stock to Crypto,
   this asset tracker can do the following:
     a. Observe the returns from periods as short as 1 week and as long as 15 years.
     b. Note the correlation between the asset and the Dow-Jones Index, and correlate the returns.
     c. Perform descriptive statistics of the asset, such as Period High, Period Low, Standard Deviation and Average Rate of Return.
     d. Show 2 beautiful graphs that measure historical closes and DJI correlation,

All done with beautiful and intuitive UI that is tailored to your comfort in using this tool. 


2. PORTFOLIO BUILDER

   The Portfolio Builder is the most unique tool you'll ever use in financial planning for investments! Use VBA Macro-enabled buttons to add new assets from either Crypto, Stock, ETF or Mutual Fund, and customize your portfolio to your liking.
   This Portfolio Builder can do the following:
     a. Can track return rates and descriptive statistics of your custom-built portfolio, providing you a snapshot of how well your portfolio has performed relative to the market.
     b. Currently supports 100 concurrent securities, though the upper limit of this can be a little buggy.
     c. Offers a high degree of freedom in customizing your portfolio with a budget tracker.

   All done with a beautiful and intuitive UI that is tailored to your comfort in using this tool.


   Thank you for using! I hope you enjoy!
