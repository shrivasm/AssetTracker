----- THE ASSET TRACKER -----

This is my project, a Macro-Enabled Excel Worksheet Project that I've been working on that I like to call the ASSET TRACKER.

   Do you want to understand how the assets we trade work? How they can be quantitatively, or visually measured? If so, the ASSET TRACKER is your best bet. Boasting over 600 securities ranging from Stock to Mutual Funds,
   this asset tracker can do the following:
     a. Observe the returns from periods as short as 1 week and as long as 15 years.
     b. Note the correlation between the asset and the Dow-Jones Index, and correlate the returns.
     c. Perform descriptive statistics of the asset, such as Period High, Period Low, Standard Deviation and Average Rate of Return.
     d. Show 2 beautiful graphs that measure historical closes and DJI correlation,

All done with beautiful and intuitive UI that is tailored to your comfort in using this tool. 


   Thank you for using! I hope you enjoy!
